Debut Feature Specification (debutf 1.0-draft)
----------------------------------------------
Extending the kitf feature specification, this document provides a set of
requirements for Drupal features to provide suitable baseline functionality
suitable to various distributions and individual site installs and at the same
time integrate effectively into a cohesive feature set. Debut features should
together provide an integrated set of functionality that covers the basic needs
of most Drupal websites and distributions.

This document is based on the Drupal 6.x versions of Drupal core, contributed
modules and themes.


1. Introduction
---------------
The kitf feature specification provides important guidelines and requirements
to ensure interoperability among Drupal features.

Building on kitf, Debut features are based on the following precepts:
* Debut features should provide the basic functionality that most sites or
distributions will need.
* Any advanced or specialized functionality should be provided in separate
features that require more basic features.
* Website feature discoverability and ease of use for both admins and end users
should be an overriding goal.
* Every main task should have only one primary admin interface.
* Common protocols and solutions should be used to ensure consistency and ease
of use.

### Uniqueness and compatibility

Wherever possible, each Debut feature should cover a unique area of
functionality. For example, there should be only a single Debut feature that
provides general blog functionality. Exceptions can be made where the
underlying framework used is radically different and there is no common base to
build on. For example, a debut_search feature could provide search enhancements
based on core Drupal search while a debut_searchlight feature provided search
through Searchlight.

### Available on the Drupal infrastructure

To ensure visibility, all Debut features should be hosted on the Drupal
infrastructure.

### Declaring compliance

Features compliant with this specification may declare themselves as such in
their module `.info` file using the `debutf` key and the version of this
document to which they comply. Example:

    debutf = "1.0-draft"

### Features framework

A feature should meet its needs through Features-aware solutions wherever
possible. Where multiple options exist, a primary selection criterion should be
how fully they embrace the Features framework.

- Context: Where context or contextual layout is required, the Context module
should be used.
- Boxes: Where custom blocks are required, the Boxes module must be used.
- Strongarm: Where variables are set, the Strongarm module should be used.
- Spaces: Where individual items (user spaces, pieces of content) require
contextual customization, the Spaces module should be used.

One of the most challenging tasks for novice site admins is controlling layout
of individual sections or pages. The Panels module is a highly advanced and
powerful solution for this purpose, but using Panels in combination with Context
is demanding and error-prone. No suitable standards have been developed yet for 
the use of Panels in Debut features. For these reasons, a feature should not
require Panels and should instead rely on Context wherever possible. Any use of
Panels should include a patch on this specification proposing standards for use
of Panels in a consistent way.

### Integrator modules

To help produce uniformity among the various Debut features, the following
helper modules should be relied upon, but not required. E.g., where appropriate,
paths variables should be set so that, if Pathauto is present, content types
defined by a feature will get appropriate paths.
- Pathauto

In addition to these integrator modules:

- Rules should be used and not the core Trigger module for any configurable
actions.

2. Namespaces
-------------

### 2.1 Code namespace

A Debut feature must include the debut namespace.
- Example: `debut_blog`.


### 2.2 Project namespace

A Debut project must include the debut namespace.
- Example: `debut_blog`.


3. User roles and permissions
-----------------------------

### 3.1 Required user roles

The `administrator` role defined in kitf should be used for site administration
tasks, such as installing and configuring modules, content types, and blocks.
The administrator role is defined by debut_admin and so should not be defined
by any other Debut feature.

In addition to the three roles defined in kitf, features should use the
following two roles as appropriate.

- `contributor` is a Drupal user who contributes content, e.g., a staff member
at an organization or company.
- `editor` is a Drupal user responsible for editing and administrating content,
taxonomies, and comments.

No additional roles may be provided by a feature.

These roles are provided by the Debut feature and so will be present if Debut
is installed. However, to avoid unwanted roles, Debut features should not
require the Debut feature.


### 3.2 Permissions

The editor role should not be expected to have `administer nodes` permissions.

For each content type introduced, roles should be assigned as follows:

- `contributor`: `create [type] content`, `delete own [type] content`, `edit
own [type] content`
- `editor`: `create [type] content`, `delete all [type] content`, `edit all
[type] content`

where [type] is the machine name of the content type being introduced by the
feature.


4. Variables
------------
A feature should include a settings form for any variables important to it.
Doing so will facilitate Spaces integration.


5. Paths and breadcrumbs
-----------------------

### 5.1 Primary path and nesting

Where features provide content or nested pages, these should wherever feasible
be available at paths nested below the feature's primary path.

Without creating a dependency on Pathauto, a feature that defines a content
type should register a pathauto pattern variable that nests content of that type
below the feature's primary page.

Example: a blog feature would use Strongarm to set pathauto_node_audio_pattern
to 'blog/[title-raw]'.


### 5.2 Menu location and breadcrumbs

Menu location and breadcrumbs for pages created by the feature should match the
nesting used for paths.

Context should be used to set breadcrumbs. For example, an article feature
including an article content type and an article landing page at 'article'
should set a context breadcrumb reaction on article node pages pointing to
the 'article' menu item.

Currently context includes a menu class reaction but doesn't set the menu
trail.

See http://drupal.org/node/835090 for a potential menu trail context reaction.


6. Block visibility and theme regions
-------------------------------------

### 6.1 Block visibility

The Context module should be used wherever feasible for block placement and
visibility. 

### 6.2 Theme regions

In addition to the the regions specified in kitf, only the following may be
used.

- `content_left`: A left column in the main page content region.
- `content_right`: A right column in the main page content region.

--------------------------------------------
left | content                       | right
     |                               |
     |                               |
     |-------------------------------|
     | content_left  | content_right |
     |               |               |
     |               |               |
     |               |               |


7. Dependencies
---------------
A feature may not depend on any feature that is not fully compliant with this
specification.

### Versions

Wherever feasible, features should use the recommended stable release versions
of contributed modules and themes.

Exceptions:
* If Context is used, version 6.3.x must be used.
* Features using Views should be tested with and compatible with Views 3,
though they need not require it.
* If jQuery Update is used, the 6.x-2.x branch should be used.
* If Captcha is used, the 6.x.2.x-dev release should be used until 
http://drupal.org/node/704110 reaches stable.

### Libraries

Any external libraries used by a feature should be installed in a libraries
directory if possible.

### Patches

Patches should be avoided wherever possible. Ideally, patches should be used
only up to and including beta releases, to include functionality expected
to reach stable releases by the time the feature is out of beta.

Where possible, patches should be replaced with workarounds in a feature's
.module file that use Drupal APIs to achieve the same ends. These workarounds
should include documentation identifying the patch that they relate to so
they can be removed if/when that patch is accepted.

### Drush make file

A feature should include a sample Drush make file including all the feature's
dependencies (modules, external libraries, etc.) that would typically be
installed with the feature.

To avoid being automatically processed by Drush Make, make files should end
with a .example extension.

For example, a debut_wysiwyg feature might include debut_wysiwyg.make.example
including the wysiwyg project and a WYSIWYG library like tinymce or ckeditor.

To ensure that any modules or libraries declared in one feature don't duplicate
those in another, the following path convention must be used:

- contrib: used for all code in Drupal's version control
- external: used for modules, themes, etc. hosted externally, e.g., modules at http://code.developmentseed.org

Examples:

; A drupal.org hosted project.
projects[jquery_ui][subdir] = contrib
; An externally hosted project.
projects[seed][subdir] = external
projects[seed][location] = http://code.developmentseed.org/fserver
; A library required by a contrib module.
libraries[jquery_ui][download][type] = "get"
libraries[jquery_ui][download][url] = "http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/files/
jquery-ui-1.7.3.zip"
libraries[jquery_ui][directory_name] = "jquery.ui"
libraries[jquery_ui][destination] = "modules/contrib/jquery_ui"


8. Content types
----------------

Where a feature defines a content type, the following guidelines should be
followed:

### Image fields

* If images are used with the content type, the feature should depend on the
Debut Image feature and use its imagecache presets wherever possible.


9. Views
--------

For consistency, the following conventions should be used for veiws included in
features.

* Naming: if the view is primarily for presenting a single content type, it
should be named for the machine name of that content type.
* At a minimum, views of a content type should include a page, block, and feed 
display, with the feed display attached to both the page and block. The page
display should have a path matching the content type's machine name and the feed
should have the same path with an .rss extension.


10. Contexts
-----------

Where appropriate, features that define a content type should include a context
that displays related content on node pages of that content type. For example,
an event feature might display a calendar block and an upcoming events block
when event content is being viewed.

For consistency, unless there are extenuating reasons, such contextual blocks
should be placed in the right region.

11. Help
--------

A feature should include contextual help provided through the Advanced Help
module covering all major components of the feature. For example, a debut_audio
feature including an audio content type with an embedded audio field, a view, and
a context might include help on all the following:
* The content type.
* How to embed an audio file.
* For each enabled embedded audio provider, specific instructions on posting
audio.
